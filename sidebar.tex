\cvproject{FlexiTest Port}
\begin{itemize}
\item Patient-centered, privacy protected testing framework leveraging blockchains/distributed data storage and zero-knowledge proof to run a point of care or home test.
%%We designed an experiment where learning agents in a virtual environment learned to play Pong with the aim of achieving expertise comparable to that of humans, with minimal training time and effort.
\end{itemize}


\cvproject{Reinforcement and Imitation learning in VirtualReality}
\begin{itemize}
\item Proposal of a novel learning mechanism which combines Reinforcement learning and Imitation learning, and explores the trade-off in performance between the two approaches. Thus, achieving expertise comparable to that of humans, with minimal training time and effort.

\cvproject{Intracranial hemorrhage detection using Neural Networks}
\begin{itemize}
\item https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08644 
%%\\The The process of reviewing medical images of the patientâ€™s cranium to look for the presence, location and type of hemorrhage is complicated and often time consuming as these scans are a combination of multiple X-Ray scans processed digitally. 
\\To reduce delays in processing of complex medical images of patient's cranium, which lead to medical complications, we propose a solution based on a Machine Vision based approach to automate the detection of intracranial hemorrhaging.

\cvproject{Portable Air Conditioner (09/2015 - 12/2015)}
\begin{itemize}
\item An Innovative approach to affordable air conditioning for user who cannot afford an A/C or the electricity costs, where the which targets the specific use of an A/C that is while sleeping, by cooling only the bed and its surroundings. A prototype for which was also made. Presented at CBSE Science Exhibition, state level on 17-19 Dec 2015.
